# project-noir
A mix between the 'investigation' and 'bullet hell' genres.
As of May/2017, it's an abandoned project (for many reasons). It was in development for about 5 months (on and off), alongside other game projects of mine.
The programming was all me ([@vinimunch](https://twitter.com/vinimunch)), the writing was my good friend [@lukeblacwood](https://twitter.com/lukeblacwood). The art was by another friend of ours.
